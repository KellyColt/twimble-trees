<Warning>
  Before using any tw.Tree Tree farm, make sure you take the relevant preparation steps as detailed in your intended Tree Type's instructions\!
</Warning>

Enter the Farm only through the marked entranceway\!
It will be marked using a sign with the Name of the Farm and an arrow\!

</Frame>

Once inside, follow the path to the Ladders that lead up into the main mechanism.

</Frame>

After climbing the ladders, you will see the Main Switch of the Farm on your immediate right\!
It should be turned off (marked by a lack of explosions).

Look below the Carpet you are standing on\! You should find 3 Hoppers next to each other which need to be configured for your specific Tree Type\! Instructions can be found on the relevant Tree Type page.

Flick the Main Switch to start the Harvesting circuit\!

Equip the correct sapling type into your Off Hand. Put your Bonemeal on your hotbar, and select it.
Ensure your ENTIRE INVENTORY (excluding potentially open armor slots) is filled with items the farm should not produce\!
Fill any open slots with <Tooltip tip="Single items taken from a stack">Dummy Items</Tooltip>\!

Once your Inventory is prepared, crouch and enter the player spot through the toggling trapdoor (enjoy being smalled uwu).
Look up at the labelled Bonemeal lever and flick it; Bonemeal should begin being dispensed next to you.

Once your Bonemeal stack is full, it should stop being dispensed as the items remain on the pressure plate.

<Tip>
  Should the Bonemeal not immediately start dropping, give it a moment to arrive before panicking\!
</Tip>

Aim your crosshairs on the top of the dirt/nylium block in front of you.
Hold down right click, which should place a sapling and immediately start bonemealing it.
Readjust your aim to ensure this.

Congratulations\! Once the Trees start growing, they should then be harvested by the explosions.
It might take multiple hits to remove the stem on top of your target block, this is normal, just keep holding right click.
Should any leaves etc spawn in front of your target block, you may just wait for them to also get exploded, or you may break them yourself.

<Info>
  For many Tree Types, not 100% of the Tree will be destroyed. Don't worry bout it, that's fine and normal (it'd be more inefficient to actually harvest everything)
</Info>

Once you have finished harvesting, remember to disable the Bonemeal dispenser, then turn off the main switch and wait for the explosions to end.
