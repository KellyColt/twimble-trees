The Bonemealer (TM) is what supplies the generic and [Mangrove](/types/mangrove) Tree farms with the Bonemeal required for operation.

It operates on a separate circuit from the Farms it supplies, meaning it must be configured and turned on before operating them.

<Warning>
  **Do NOT** leave the Bonemealer running after use. Always turn it off when you're done!!!

  It can and will break if Lazy-Loaded because you walked away / logged off and left it running, and it is a pain to fix and I will complain the entire time.
</Warning>

# Operation

The Bonemealer's controls and overflow storage can be accessed through the Warped Beanstalk Tunnel. Come on up!

<Note>
The Bonemealer's **Overflow Storage** is currently only accessible through the Staff Only areas. While you are discouraged from poking around there, if needing bonemeal, you may exit through the marked Staff Only door and look immediately to your right, where you will see a chest on two hoppers. Bonemeal in this chest is generally fine to take.

If no Bonemeal is available: Disable all Outputs and the Output Engine, then enable the farm and let it run for a while.
