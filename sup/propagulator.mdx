The Propagulator (TM) is a machine which turns 5 bonemeal into 1 [Mangrove](/types/mangrove) Propagule.
As Mangroves are the only tree type with saplings that do not drop in great numbers from the leaves (or can be easily renewed using a Nylium Farm which self-renews its bonemeal), the Propagulator(TM) is the official way to get Mangrove Saplings in bulk.

# Preparation

Before enabling the Propagulator, you must ensure it has sufficient bonemeal to function\!

To grow one stack of Propagules, the machine requires 5 stacks of Bonemeal.
However, it is not 100% efficient so exactly 5 stacks will likely result in a little less than 64 Propagules.
The Fueling mechanism is described below.

<Warning>
  Using the Propagulator to grow **less than 20** Propagules at a time is not encouraged. Decent efficiency can only be achieved at 32 or more.
</Warning>

## Fueling

There are 5 Dispensers which must be provided with about equal amounts of bonemeal.
Once one of them runs out, the machine ceases to function (however, the remaining bonemeal is still used, so pay close attention to the machine and be ready to turn it off as to prevent waste).
Find the Dispensers as follows:

# Operation

Once you have ensured proper Bonemeal Distribution, flick the lever on the side of the farm.

At this point, Propagules should start being pushed into the Output Chest quite rapidly.

Listen closely to the ticking of the machine. Once it runs out of Bonemeal, the sound will change, letting you know it is time to quickly turn it back off to conserve Bonemeal\!
