<Info>
  Mangrove wood is by far the most Bonemeal-costly wood type.
  As it takes 5 bonemeal to even just obtain a propagule, and then more to grow the tree, it eats through Bonemeal like no other Tree.

  While these Farms where obviously made to be used, **please do not overuse Mangrove wood** when other wood will do (e.g. for crafting chests), as a courtesy to other users who share your bonemeal supply.

<Steps>
  <Step title="propagules u">
    Before farming mangrove wood, you need to acquire a sufficient amount of Propagules!
    Mangrove Propagules do not renew during harvesting, so having enough for your needs going in is important.

    This can be done using the [Propagulator](/sup/propagulator)
  </Step>
  <Step title="bonemeals u">
    The Mangrove Farm's Bonemeal supply comes from the [Bonemealer](/sup/bonemelee).
    It must be configured and properly enabled before use, please follow the [instructions](/sup/bonemelee#operation) provided for it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="farms u">
    Farming Mangrove is done using the **dedicated Mangrove Farm**, it cannot be done in any other!!!
    Once inside, enter the Player Spot and look up. Follow the "Propagules" arrow to the chest above and to your right, and put all but one stack of Propagules inside.

    Enable the Farm as described in the [Basic Operation](/basics) section, turning on the Harvester and Bonemeal Dispensary.
    Afterwards, also enable the lever at the top right of the Player Spot to enable the Propagule Dispenser.
    
    Begin operation as usual. While farming, you should be fed both Bonemeal and Propagules from the dispensers.
